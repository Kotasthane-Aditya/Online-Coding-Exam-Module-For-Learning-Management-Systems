Developed a web-based code execution platform integrated into a Learning Management System (LMS) to facilitate online coding assessments. 
This system allows professors to assign coding questions to students based on difficulty levels, either randomly or manually. 
Students can log in, access the question page, select their preferred programming language, and write code in the built-in editor. 
The backend compiles and executes the source code, allowing students to test their solutions against predefined test cases or custom manual input with real-time output feedback.
Once completed, students can submit their code, and both professors and students can view and download submitted solutions for further evaluation. 
This project ensures efficient assessment, real-time execution, and seamless integration within the LMS for an enhanced learning experience.
